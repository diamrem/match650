R. China","Bio":"陆汝钤，男， 1935 年生于上海。 1959 年毕业于德国耶拿大学数学系，获学士学位，同年起进入中国科学院数学研究所工作。 1978 年起任副研究员。 1983 年起任研究员。 1984 年起 任 博士生导师。 1987 年至 1990 年任中科院数学研究所副所长。 1991 年至 1994 年任中科院数学研究所学术委员会主任。 1999 年当选为中科院院士。 2000 年加盟复旦大学，任计算机系教授。 2002 年至 2003 年任复旦大学智能信息处理开放实验室主任。 2004 年起任上海市智能信息处理重点实验室学术委员会主任。\n\n陆汝钤在人工智能、知识工程和基于知识的软件工程方面进行了深入系统的创造性工作，是我国该研究领域的开拓者和先驱者。 同时他还积极参加社会学术活动，获得以下职称和职务：中科院计算所终身研究员；北京市多媒体和智能软件重点实验室学术委员会主任；中科院计算机科学重点实验室学术委员会副主任；中科院管理、决策和信息系统重点实验室学术委员会副主任；中国计算机学会模式识别与人工智能专业委员会副主任；软件学报常务副主任； Database Technology ( 英国 ) 编委； Computer Journal ( 英国 ) 编委； Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science ( 德国， Springer 出版社丛书 ) 顾问委员会委员；等等。\n\n在早期软件工程方面，陆汝钤倡导并主持完成了以软件的机械化生成和移植为目标的系列软件计划（ XR 计划），有力地推动了当时国产机软件缺乏问题的解决。该项目计划为期七年，国内共有三十多所科研院所和高等院校参加，之后获全国科学大会先进集体奖和中科院 1983 年重大成果一等奖。\n\n陆汝钤于 20 世纪 80 年代初进入知识工程领域。知识工程强调以人类知识作为机器智能的基础，研究知识的表示、获取、转换、推理和应用，它曾帮助人工智能研究走出了上世纪七十年代的低谷，又被上世纪八十年代以来的各国高技术计划采用，视作推动技术进步的关键手段。他的工作主要有如下几个方面。\n\n陆汝钤设计并主持研制了知识工程语言 TUILI 和大型专家系统开发环境《天马》。其中 TUILI 语言对国际上广泛使用的 PROLOG 语言做了多方面的本质改进。它综合逻辑程序设计和产生式系统两种风范，体现模块化和层次化的启发式控制，可作 60 种不同策略的推理，技术上有独创性，应用上有独特优势。 TUILI 系统已应用于多个领域，尤其是在灾害天气预报中起了重要作用。大型专家系统开发环境《天马》是陆汝钤主持的国家七五攻关项目 “ 专家系统开发环境 ” 的主要成果，它包括四部推理机，三个知识获取系统和四个接口生成系统。专家鉴定认为《天马》是国产同类软件中功能最强的，与国外最大的同类软件规模相当，达到国际先进水平。《天马》已占领国内大型专家系统开发工具市场，并应用于国防和经济的二十多个领域，取得了重要的经济和社会效益。《天马》项目获 1992 年中科院科技进步一等奖， 1993 年国家科技进步二等奖。\n\n陆汝钤在 1985 年发表的分布式人工智能（ DAI) 文章，提出了分布式专家联合思想及其总体设计，是国际上第一篇异构型 DAI 文章，并首次把机器辩论引进人工智能领域。他还设计和主持实现了多个 DAI 软件系统，包括两个分布式逻辑推理语言和一个基于知识的分布式城市交通管理软件。\n\n人类的生产和社会实践积累了浩瀚的数字和文字素材，其中蕴含着不可估量的知识，仅靠人力已难于充分提炼和挖掘。专家公认，知识获取是知识工程中的瓶颈问题。从技术资料中自动获取知识的主要困难是自然语言理解。鉴于现阶段的技术水平不能做到完全的自然语言理解，陆汝钤研究出基于类自然语言理解的一套技术，可以在只对书面语言作很少改动的情况下由计算机自动获取并整理隐含于资料中的知识，这为领域知识库的自动生成和自动演化，并最后自动生成所需的应用软件提供了基础。从而形成了一条基于知识自动获取的软件快速生成，特别是专家系统、 ICAI 系统和 MIS 系统的自动生成的新技术路线。该方法有利于把这类软件的生成技术从手工编制（第一代），用开发工具和平台编制（第二代），向基于知识自动获取的自动生成（第三代）推进。专家鉴定认为是该技术是国内外首创、居国际领先地位。\n\n陆汝钤把类自然语言理解和软件工程中的领域分析和领域建模结合起来，提出了 “ 前需求分析 ” 概念及其实现技术。企业管理人员只需用本行业的语言把企业情况表述清楚，计算机即可在领域知识库的支持下自动做需求分析，提出设计方案并编程实现管理信息系统（ MIS ），从而为软件工程中的老大难问题：需求分析，找到了一种新的解决办法。 1994 年英国 AI WATCH 杂志用整整一页篇幅发表评论指出这是他们所见到的 “ 以领域知识库支持主流软件开发的第一例 ” ， “ 很有可能发展为可实用的工业工具 ” ，并就此提出： “ 看来是欧洲的人工智能 / 软件工业界与中国的人工智能界建立联系的时候了 ” 。\n\n现有的计算机技术只能在动画生产过程的最后阶段辅助人绘制画面。陆汝钤经过近十年的研究，提出了一套全过程计算机辅助动画生成技术，使计算机能从受限自然语言理解开始，把中文童话故事自动转换成动画片，包括自动执行脚本改编，电影导演和电影摄影的功能，在艺术创造领域内发展了人工智能技术，并体现于他主持研制的软件《天鹅》中。专家鉴定认为该技术难度极大，是国内外首创，并居国际领先地位。它的推广应用将有可能大幅提高动画片生产效率，并进一步改变动画片生产的面貌。\n\n在形式语义学研究方面，陆汝钤把原来只能描述静态控制结构的代数语义，推广到能描述动态控制结构 , 使代数语义具备描述完整程序控制结构的能力，从而真正体现 “ 对代数语义来说，程序即抽象数据类型 ” 这一论题。陆汝钤还把数学中黎曼曲面的思想引进 PETRI 网论，建立了多层 PETRI 网模型 —— P/R 网 , 并应用 P/R 网给出了 CCS 的完全真并发语义，彻底解决了其特有的（在双模拟意义下的）语义等价问题。\n\n在计算机科学理论方面，陆汝钤从事了多方面的研究并取得了很好的科研成果，包括编译理论、定理证明、形式语言理论、形式语义学、量子自动机等等。\n\n陆汝钤共发表论文 100 余篇，专著七本，其中三本在国外出版。陆汝钤曾获中科院一等奖两次，国家科技进步二等奖一次，全国科学大会奖一次，华罗庚数学奖一次，以及国家有突出贡献的中青年专家称号一次。","PictureUrl":"http://pic0.aminer.org/picture/02210/Lu_Ruqian_1324137292012.jpg","Hindex":0}]

In addition, he has done important work in long-duration transactions, nested transactions and database design.\n\nSince joining HP in 1992, Dayal has initiated several research programs, including the intelligent enterprise research program, which combines decision technologies, business-process management and enterprise solutions technologies. \n\nThis work, a key element of HP\u0027s Adaptive Enterprise strategy, is centered on creating technologies to improve HP’s business processes and developing innovative technologies for increasing the efficiency and value of HP’s service design and delivery capabilities. Research in these areas has created competitive advantage for HP in such areas as revenue forecasting and auction design. \n\nPreviously, Dayal initiated HP’s research in business process intelligence, a field of study that combines data warehousing, data mining, analytics and optimization techniques to monitor, control and improve business processes. \n\nIn addition to holding 13 patents, Dayal has published more than 120 papers at conferences and in journals. In 2001, he received the prestigious 10-year best paper award (with two co-authors) from the International Conference on Very Large Data Bases for his paper on a transactional model for long-running activities, which was deemed to have been “the most influential paper written ten years ago.” This paper is widely regarded as launching the field of enterprise-scale, transactional workflow management. \n\nDayal is on the Editorial Board of four international journals, has co-edited two books and has chaired and served on the Program Committees of numerous conferences. He is a member of the Board of the VLDB Endowment, the Board of the International Foundation for Cooperative Information Systems, the Steering Committee of the SIAM Data Mining Conference and the Executive Committee of the IEEE Technical Committee on E-Commerce. \n\nPrior to joining HP Labs., he was a senior researcher at DEC\u0027s Cambridge Research Lab., Chief Scientist at Xerox Advanced Information Technology and Computer Corporation of America, and on the faculty at the University of Texas-Austin.

Currently I am focusing on the following areas:\n\neScience: Data Management and Analysis Services for the Sciences\nSince September 2004 I am working on novel approaches for tracking environmental change based on bird abundance data. Currently we are mining a wealth of observational data hosted by Cornell\u0027s Lab of Ornithology in order to determine the relationship between environmental features and the abundance of wild bird species in North America [CEMR+06, KHFR+09]. A major direction of our research is to develop highly accurate prediction models [HCFM+07]; this work has already resulted in a novel regression technique that produces better predictions than state-of-the art methods [SCR07]. We also recently started to explore new approaches to enable scientists to discover interesting patterns in the complex prediction models trained from the collected data [PRF10]. One important type of patterns are statistical interactions between predictor variables [SCRF08, SCRH+09].\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 0427914, 0612031, and 0920869. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.\n\nI have worked with domain scientists from different areas since 1999. In recent collaborations with physicists at Cornell\u0027s Wilson Lab the emphasis was on mining high-energy physics data and on managing metadata and provenance for elementary particle physics [DGJK+08]. Our work with the Cornell Astronomy department is surveyed in [CCD+04]. Data flow challenges for managing and analyzing astronomy data, elementary particle physics, and snapshots of the WWW are discussed in [AAC+06]. We recently started working with researchers in Cornell\u0027s Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. The goal of this collaboration is to improve the performance of long-running complex simulations of combustions [PRPG+06, PRGP07].\n","PictureUrl":"http://aminer.org/pictures/picture/00959/M_Riedewald_1325954219305.jpg","Hindex":0}]
